# Go Restful API Boilerplate
### Features
The following feature set is a minimal selection of typical Web API requirements:

- Configuration using [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
- CLI features using [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
- [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) for dependency management
- PostgreSQL support including migrations using [go-pg](https://github.com/go-pg/pg)
- Structured logging with [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus)
- Routing with [chi router](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) and middleware
- JWT Authentication using [jwt-go](https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go) in combination with passwordless email authentication (could be easily extended to use passwords instead)
- Request data validation using [ozzo-validation](https://github.com/go-ozzo/ozzo-validation)
- HTML emails with [gomail](https://github.com/go-gomail/gomail)

### Start Application

go get -u github.com/dhax/go-base/cmd

- Clone this repository
- Create a postgres database and set environment variable *DATABASE_URL* accordingly if not using same as default
- Build the application: ```go build``` to create ```go-base``` binary or use ```go run main.go``` instead in the following commands
- Run ```go-base``` for cobra generated help message.
- Initialize the database migrations table: ```go-base migrate init```
- Run all migrations found in ./database/migrate with: ```go-base migrate```
- Run the application: ```go-base serve```

### API Routes

For passwordless login following routes are available:

Path | Method | Required JSON | Header | Description
---|---|---|---|---
/auth/login | POST | email | | the email you want to login with (see below)
/auth/token | POST | token | | the token you received via email (or printed to stdout if smtp not set)
/auth/refresh | POST | | Authorization: "Bearer refresh_token" | refresh JWTs
/auth/logout | POST | | Authorizaiton: "Bearer refresh_token" | logout from this device

Besides /auth/* the API provides to main routes /api/* and /admin/* to distinguish between application and administration features. The latter requires to be logged in as administrator by providing the respective JWT in Authorization Header.

Check [routes.md](routes.md) file for an overview of the provided API routes.

#### Demo client application
For demonstration of the login and account management features this API also serves a Single Page Application (SPA) as a Progressive Web App (PWA) done with [Quasar Framework](http://quasar-framework.org) which itself is powered by [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). The client's source code can be found [here](https://github.com/dhax/go-base-client).

If no valid email smtp settings are provided by environment variables, emails will be print to stdout showing the login token. Use one of the following users for login:
- admin@boot.io (has access to admin panel)
- user@boot.io

A deployed version can also be found on [Heroku](https://govue.herokuapp.com)

### Environment Variables

Name | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---
PORT | string | localhost:3000 | http address (accepts also port number only for heroku compability)  
LOG_LEVEL | string | debug | log level
LOG_TEXTLOGGING | bool | false | defaults to json logging
DATABASE_URL | string | postgres://postgres:postgres<br>@localhost:5432/gobase?sslmode=disable | PostgreSQL connection string
AUTH_LOGIN_URL | string | http://localhost:3000/login | client login url as sent in login token email
AUTH_LOGIN_TOKEN_LENGTH | int | 8 | length of login token
AUTH_LOGIN_TOKEN_EXPIRY | time.Duration | 11m | login token expiry
AUTH_JWT_SECRET | string | random | jwt sign and verify key - value "random" creates random 32 char secret at startup (and automatically invalidates existing tokens on app restarts, so during dev you might want to set a fixed value here)
AUTH_JWT_EXPIRY | time.Duration | 15m | jwt access token expiry
AUTH_JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRY | time.Duration | 1h | jwt refresh token expiry
EMAIL_SMTP_HOST | string || email smtp host (if set and connection can't be established then app exits)
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT | int || email smtp port
EMAIL_SMTP_USER | string || email smtp username
EMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD | string || email smtp password
